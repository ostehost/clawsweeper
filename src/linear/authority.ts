/**
 * Linear mutation authority, receipts, and safety gates (deterministic, offline, pure).
 *
 * Doctrine — read, write, propose; never the other way round:
 *   This module is the authorization layer between a review-only triage plan and any
 *   real Linear mutation. It decides nothing about *what* to change; it decides
 *   *whether* a proposed change is permitted. Every decision is a pure function of the
 *   request, the explicitly-resolved safety gates, and a drift-fingerprint receipt.
 *   No network, no clock, no I/O. It pairs with the review-only classifier: the
 *   classifier proposes, this layer authorizes, and a downstream deterministic script
 *   (never Codex, never a review run) holds the short-lived token that applies.
 *
 * Safety gates default closed:
 *   Every write capability — comment post, label write, state change, priority change,
 *   close — is independently gated and defaults to false. `resolveGates` always starts
 *   from REVIEW_ONLY_GATES (all closed) and opens only the gates explicitly set to
 *   `true`, so disabling one gate can never open another, and an empty or omitted
 *   config is review-only. A mutation whose gate is closed is denied.
 *
 * Drift-fingerprint receipts:
 *   Apply is gated behind the existing snapshotHash / planHash contract. A mutation is
 *   authorized only when the plan's snapshotHash still equals the live snapshot hash
 *   recomputed at apply time (no drift since the snapshot) and the plan's planHash
 *   equals the operator-approved plan hash. `MutationReceipt` is the audit trail; it
 *   carries hashes, keys, and reasons — never secrets or tokens.
 *
 * Never close without concrete evidence:
 *   Closing a Linear issue requires a `decision: "close"` evidence record whose
 *   closeReason is one of ClawSweeper's decision-taxonomy reasons (never "none").
 *   Maintainer-authored issues are never closeable. A close must be requested as kind
 *   "close" (not as a generic "state-change" into a terminal state) so the evidence
 *   gate applies.
 *
 * Label writes merge, never replace:
 *   Linear's issueUpdate replaces the full labelIds array. A "label-add" request must
 *   carry the existing labels, the additions, and the full proposed set; authorization
 *   rejects any write whose proposed set drops an existing label or differs from the
 *   union of existing ∪ additions. Use `mergeLabels` to compute that union.
