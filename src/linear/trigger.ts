/**
 * Linear weekly-cron and on-demand trigger wiring + run-expectations contract
 * (deterministic, offline, pure).
 *
 * Doctrine — schedule lives gateway-side, logic lives in a committed script:
 *   Weekly Linear triage runs from an OpenClaw cron job on the hub (user `ostemini`),
 *   not a local launchd timer. Keeping the schedule gateway-side means it survives
 *   node reinstalls, gets built-in failure alerting, and keeps an audit trail in
 *   `openclaw cron runs`. The cron agent only routes and summarizes; the real logic
 *   lives in the committed review-only runner (`scripts/linear-triage.mjs`). This
 *   module builds the cron trigger spec, the on-demand handle, and the run-expectations
 *   contract as pure values — no network, no clock, no I/O.
 *
 * On-demand uses the same entry:
 *   There is one cron entry. A human or another agent triggers an out-of-band run with
 *   `openclaw cron run <id>` (optionally `--wait --expect-final` to block on the final
 *   sentinel). This is the Linear-side equivalent of ClawSweeper's `repository_dispatch`
 *   trigger for exact GitHub events.
 *
 * Review-only by default:
 *   The cron message always invokes the runner with `--review-only --json`; no mutate
 *   flag is ever wired into the schedule. Weekly runs snapshot, classify, and emit a
 *   digest — they never apply. Any real mutation is gated separately in authority.ts.
 *
 * Sentinels and expectations:
 *   A healthy run ends with a recognized sentinel — `TRIAGE_OK` for a clean run or
 *   `TRIAGE_ALERT_SENT` when the run escalated. The expectations contract mirrors the
 *   convention used by existing cron jobs: `deliveryStrict`, `semanticFailurePatterns`,
 *   and `maxRunAgeMs`. `evaluateRunExpectations` is a pure verdict over a run outcome
 *   and the contract, so alerting stays deterministic and clock-free.
 *
 * Hub user path, never the macbook node:
 *   The cron runs as `ostemini`, so the script path must be a `/Users/ostemini/...`
 *   path. A `/Users/ostehost/...` path (this MacBook node) would break the cron, so the
 *   spec builder rejects it outright.
