/**
 * Review policy — project-agnostic mapping from a classification to advisory labels and a
 * suggested next step (deterministic, offline, pure).
 *
 * Doctrine — one default policy for every project, propose-only:
 *   ClawSweeper classifies an issue; this layer turns that classification into (a) exactly
 *   ONE advisory routing label proposal and (b) a human-readable "suggested next step" for
 *   the review comment. It is the single place that encodes "what should happen next" so the
 *   same rules apply to EVERY Linear project with no per-project input. It proposes; a human
 *   or the next agent disposes. It never closes and never emits an action/control label.
 *
 * Keyed only on signals that already exist:
 *   Every rule reads only fields the classifier/record already produce — disposition,
 *   eligible, staleCandidate, closeCandidateReason, triagePriority, itemCategory, and the
 *   issue's existing label NAMES. No new fetch, no clock, no I/O. So the policy is a pure
 *   function and unit-testable with frozen fixtures, exactly like the classifier.
 *
 * Two invariants live OUTSIDE the rule table so no rule (or future per-project override)
 * can break them:
 *   1. PROTECTED_ACTION_LABELS — a denylist filter applied AFTER rule evaluation. The policy
 *      can never propose an action/control/proof/mantis label or a priority label; those are
 *      reported in the comment body, never written by this layer.
 *   2. REVIEW_ROUTING_LABELS — the owned set the reconciler (`nextReviewLabels`) may add or
 *      remove. Everything else on an issue (action labels, proof/mantis, the protected
 *      human-review / linked-pr-open echoes, and any project's own labels) is preserved.
 *
 * Future per-project override (designed, NOT wired): `evaluateReviewPolicy` takes an
 * optional `overrideRules` array consulted before the default table (first-match-wins).
 * Because rules are pure data, a per-project policy is just another array — no code fork.
