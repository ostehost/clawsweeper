# Public observer API

- Status: active operator reference
- Owner: ClawSweeper dashboard maintainers
- Source of truth: `dashboard/worker.ts` request routing and its focused tests
- Last verified: `openclaw/clawsweeper@2b5b345063efe1690e1d802fb1a738aa6a408707`
- Update when: a public observer route, method, query parameter, response source, or authentication boundary changes
- Checked by: `pnpm run check:docs`

The dashboard Worker exposes the following unauthenticated observer routes. They
support current dashboard and operator diagnostics; this inventory does not
promise a versioned compatibility period. Routes under `/internal/`, event
ingest, and the GitHub webhook are mutation or trust-boundary surfaces and are
deliberately not public API. `ANY` records a current method-agnostic routing
branch, not a promise that every method will remain supported.

`config/operator-documentation.json` is the checked route inventory. Adding or
removing a literal observer route in `dashboard/worker.ts` requires updating
that manifest and this table. The checker excludes `/api/events`, because it is
an ingest mutation rather than an observer route.

For field interpretation, use [Live dashboard](live-dashboard.md). For the
rendered lane model, use [OpenClaw Bay](openclaw-bay-demo.md).
